# Creating your own custom floorplan-file from scratch #

This is a short guide to creating your own floorplan-file, based on your own home.

Recommended resources:
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) for editing your floorplan
- [the Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/) for neat looking custom icons

## 1. Get started
Download, install and open [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/).

## 1.1 Set the size of the work area
I've set the size of my floorplan-file to match the resolution of a full-screen iPad Air (1024x768).
- Click File > Document Properties
- Ensure the top right corner says "px" as display units. There is another one under "Custom size" that should also read "px".
- Set the width and height of Orientation/custom size to 1024 by 768.
- Make sure scale = 1
- Set view box x, y, width and height to: 0, 0, 1024, 768.
- Close the document properties and save the file as floorplan.svg

## 1.2 Draw your building
Start drawing your house/apartment using rectangles. Add two placeholders for lights using the circle tool (or download and insert more classy looking ones from the Noun Project). Also add a text string that we will be using for showing the temperature. These steps have been taken in the image below.

## 1.3 Link the items to entities in Home Assistant
To link an object in the floorplan-file to Home Assistant, you first set its object id to the name of the entity in Home Assistant. There are two lights: ```light.hall_1``` and ```light.hall_2``` as well as a temperature sensor ```sensor.forecastio_apparent_temperature```.
- To link an entity, right click one of the circles and select "Object properties". You will see something along "ID: xzyy3212".
- Set the ID to light.hall_1 as shown in the image below. Click "Set".
- Click outside of the circle and click inside it again and make sure Inkscape hasn't added "_" to the end of the ID.
- Do the same for the other light and also with the text.

## 1.4 Add the necessary config to your floorplan.yaml-file
Add the following lines to your floorplan.yaml file:

```
    - name: temp_forecastio
      entities:
        - sensor.forecastio_apparent_temperature
      text_template: '${entity.state ? Math.ceil(entity.state) + "Â°": "undefined"}'
      class_template: 'return "static-temp";'

  - name: Lights
    entities:
      - light.hall_1
      - light.hall_2
    states:
      - state: 'on'
        class: 'light-on'
      - state: 'off'
        class: 'light-off'
```

## 1.5 Upload your floorplan
Upload and overwrite the floorplan.svg file with your own, customized, file.

## 1.6 Restart Home Assistant
You need to do this in order to pick up the changes you made to the floorplan.yaml-file.
